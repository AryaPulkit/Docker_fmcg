Building our Docker Images Automatically When we Push dockerfile on GitHub.
Since Docker Hub integrates with GitHub, allowing us to automatically build our containerâ€™s image when new code is pushed and docker image ready to be pulled from Dockerhub.automated tests can be executed to ensure your image was built as expected before the image becomes available for download.
